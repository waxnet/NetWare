### <p align="center"> End of Development & Support </p>
<p align="center">
As of October 2025, 1v1.LOL is shutting down. Because of this, **NetWare will no longer be developed or supported**.

### <p align="center"> Why? </p>
<p align="center">
NetWare started out as a completely free personal project, a way for me to learn C# and explore a new world of programming. It was never intended to be big, nor was it expected to gain much attention. <br><br>
What began as a small learning experiment quickly grew into something far beyond what I ever imagined. The community embraced it, shared it and turned it into a project that reached countless players. Watching NetWare evolve alongside 1v1.lol has been an incredible experience. <br><br>
With the closure of 1v1.LOL, the natural conclusion of this journey has arrived. Without the game, there is no longer a purpose for NetWare’s development, but the lessons learned and the memories made along the way will always remain.
